Todo:
1. Put Cluster detection as one central process of this code, and plot with the detection plot method.
2. Add Extact spot information.
3. Add load background image and detection
4. Add finding threshold for Gaussing fitting and spot intensity
5. Rule out spot using Gaussian fitting filter and intensity filter.
6. Plot the final detected image with plot.
