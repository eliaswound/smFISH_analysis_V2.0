This is a instruction on using stardist on planarians nuclei.
I saved the old 3D using 3D demo model on for_reference_old_3D_segmentation.py.
Do not use this code, just use it as a reference for running 3D segmentation and creating labels.
2D_single_stack_segmentation_main.py and 2D_single_stack_segmentation_quest.py are used for local and on-server segmentation on 2D.
Later on I will decide what is the next step for this code.
Maybe I will add training model in 3D and other codes instead, so please let me take my time to develop.
